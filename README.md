# Ecommerce-product-recommendation-system-main
I built an E-commerce Product Recommender using content-based filtering. Using TF-IDF and cosine similarity, the system suggested similar products based on descriptions and attributes. This project improved my Python, NLP, and data preprocessing skills, and showed how data science enhances personalization in e-commerce platforms.
